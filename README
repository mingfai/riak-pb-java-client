This is an archived project and I'm not going to further develop this. Whoever found it by chance may use it as a
reference to develop a Riak ProtoBuff Java client with JBoss Netty.

I've implemented ping, list buckets and list keys. With the framework, it is actually not hard to implement the other
interfaces.


The following are some difference of my approach in compare to Krestenkrab's riak-java-pb-client are:

1. use Netty NIO
    - Krestenkrak's implementation uses a custom synchronous socket connection per thread (using threadlocal).
    
2. changed client interface
    - considered both Java and Groovy API usage
    - native Java, it shall not expose Netty or ProtoBuf interface
    - e.g. for list buckets, in Krestenkrak's implementation, the signature is:
           public ByteString[] listBuckets() throws IOException

           I personally think returning a Google ProtoBuf ByteString isn't a good idea.

The reason I stop the development is that I've decided not to use Riak. Riak is indeed among the best NoSQL product. It
 ranked the first in my evaluation but unfortunately I have decided to use a Java-based solution.
